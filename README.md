## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery
My level facilitates discovery through my use of developing verbs. When the player starts the level he is greeted by a small ledge with a much bigger ledge right after, this design isolates the jump mechanic and allows the player to get familiar with how they can manipulate the height of their jump. The first ledge is reachable through the player tapping the space bar, whilst the second ledge requires the player to hold the space bar. After this my level incorporates an easy platforming section to help the player practice the jump mechanic before introducing the staff. This small section at the start ensures that the player can build off the most simple yet important mechanic of a standard platformer whilst also introducing moving platforms to teach the player what to expect later on in terms of jumping. After that the player is introduced to the staff and the gun, my level allows the player to try out both weapons by introducing two types of enemies one ranged one melee. Lastly to finish off the first section there is one of three keys that the player can collect and as such will introduce the player to the core mechanics and goal of the game. From then on the level incorporates combinations of these mechanics in order to create situations in which the player will need to think out of the box in order to get past certain gaps or doors. For example there's a hole that requires the player to mix the jump and the attack mechanic in order to gain enough distance to cross the gap as just jumping is impossible. Thus building relationships between the mechanics, furthermore to finish off the five steps in developing your verbs my level has a section in which the player must jump precisely across a series of one pixel wide towers thus developing nuanced control.


### 1.2. Drama
My level starts off quite relaxing and tame at the start in order to help the player ease into the unfamiliarity of the game and to allow me to build tension. Furthermore, whenever my game has a section that would be considered "hard" it's followed up by a section that is more relaxing and easy in order to ensure that the player also feels a sense of relief as opposed to just tension. Specifically moments like one of the platforming sections in my level in which you must cross numerous gaps whilst being shot at. This would invoke the feeling of tension whilst the next section (a part thats still difficult but not as stressful due to the lack of an enemy shooting at you) would give the player some relief.

### 1.3. Challenge
The main type of challenge in my level is physical skill with a bit of perceptive skill. I've designed my level to contain sections in which there is a much higher need for physical skill in contrast to the rest of the game, by having this contrast I keep players in the flow channel as the level isn't too easy or too hard. Furthermore the occasional puzzle in my level helps keep the level fresh and as such stimulates the player nad further helps maintain the state of flow. Furthermore my level despite allowing the player to choose if they want to do section 2 or section 3 first still provides a clear objective so that the player doesn't lose interest from not knowing what to do/where to go.

### 1.4. Exploration
My level facilitates autonomy through the different ways that the player could solve puzzles/go through the level, it allows the players the players to go throught the level how they want to which in turn leads to exploration. Furthermore the layout of my level has paths that lead to areas however the areas are cut off from the cameras view so it would require the player to explore these paths in order to see what they lead to. Alongside this, my level also has a little easter egg in which the player can easily find if they decide to explore a little bit, thus in a larger scale game, would motivate the player to explore me and go off the "intended" path. Lastly I used a boss encounter which once again in future levels could be used to guard collectibles (in this instance its just used to guard a key) which would further prompt the player to explore.


## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Checkpoints

### 2.2. Acid

### 2.3. MovingPlatforms

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Passthrough Platform

### 2.6. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

### 2.7. Chompers

### 2.8. Spitters

### 2.9. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.10. Spikes

### 2.11. Keys

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Iterative design was highly practical and advantageous throughout the design process for my level. Through the use of iterative design in particular grey-boxing I was firstly able to create a layout that I desired through constantly testing the spacing between areas etc. This meant that I was able to easily change experiences in my level in order to target more of those player experience factors. Furthermore iterative design helped me pick ideal places for pickups and enemies and it allowed me to decide whether checkpoints were needed in certain areas. As such, it allowed me to control the challenge of the level through the appropriate placement of these structures to ensure that the level wasn't too difficult or too easy. For example if a section was tricky the process of iterative design helped me determine whether a checkpoint would have been appropriate for that section. In particular, during the testing I was able to discover certain ledges that might've been too high up thus leading to a soft-lock if the player were to fall into the pit. Another example in which iterative design helped was during my boss fight section. Through constantly playing this section it allowed me to determine a suitable range to set my enemies attacks to and a suitable health pool for the enemies, thus allowing me to create a more engaging bossfight that stimulates the player's reactions and physical skill. However I believe an aspect that my level could improve on is the exploration of the level. Through iterative design I noticed that although my level did have sections to allow the player to explore and find things, it would have been a lot more enjoyable if my puzzles required more exploration. Iterative design also allowed me to see that health pickups could be placed in more unique locations rather than just at the end of a section which would have further improved the exploration aspect of my level. 

As shown in my images provided of grey-boxing, the width and distance between ground was a factor that iterative design really helped me nail in my level. For example in certain areas I extended platforms by one pixel just to allow more space for the player, furthermore, moving platforms were also added for sections that might've been a bit too far apart. It was however through grey-boxing that I was able to make these small changes that would have significantly impacted the player's experience in my level. Thus showing that iterative design helped improve my level through many small changes that could have only been done through actually testing the game.


Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.
